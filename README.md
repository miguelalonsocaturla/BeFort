This Android mobile application leverages Firebase to manage and display the biosaludable and mobility parks of Valencia.
It allows users to view parks on a map, find the nearest one, and check the available fitness machines at each location. 
The app also includes a list of public parks and a catalog of machines, detailing the types of exercises and muscle groups they target, designed both for muscle development and mobility recovery.

Moreover, the app aims to be a useful tool for the Valencia City Hall, enabling them to efficiently manage and update their public inventory for better governance and resource optimization.
